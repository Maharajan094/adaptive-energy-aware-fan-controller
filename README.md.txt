# Adaptive Energy-Aware Fan Controller

An intelligent fan control system that dynamically adjusts fan speed by analyzing temperature trends instead of relying on fixed thresholds.

## Problem Statement
Traditional fan controllers react only to instantaneous temperature, leading to unnecessary power consumption.

## Proposed Solution
The system analyzes recent temperature readings to detect thermal trends and adjusts fan speed to optimize energy usage.
